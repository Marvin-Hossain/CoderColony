Welcome to README! This will be updated overtime as changes are made.

    Maven automatically takes care of building and managing dependencies via this file

.idea: Stores project's IDE settings. No need to interact directly.

.mvn: Holds Maven wrapper configurations. It's automatically managed, no need to interact.

resources/application.properties: Configuring Spring Boot application. Will need to interact
    to define things like database credentials, logging levels, etc.
